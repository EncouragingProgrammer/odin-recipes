About me: 
My name is Ryan and I've been working through the Odin project as a way to supplement my education!I am currently working towards my Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Systems. The Odin project appealed to me as a good way to learn and practice Linux, github and git (version control), HTML, CSS and javascript. 
About this project: 
This is the first major project which involves developing a recipe website. In this first version of the website, I will be primarly focusing on the HTML elements with the intention of adding CSS later on. Through this process I am also working on intentional practice with Linux and github.
Current progress:
Oct 24, 2021 Getting the project setup in a github repository. Created the index.html file with 3 recipe files.
